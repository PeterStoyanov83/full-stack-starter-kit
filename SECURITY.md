# Security Policy

## Security Features

This application implements enterprise-grade security features:

### üîê Authentication & Authorization
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** with Google Authenticator
- **JWT tokens** via Laravel Sanctum
- **Role-based access control** (6 distinct roles)
- **Profile activation** system requiring 2FA setup

### üõ°Ô∏è Data Protection
- **Activity logging** with complete audit trail
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **SQL injection** protection via Eloquent ORM
- **XSS protection** via Laravel's built-in helpers
- **CSRF protection** for state-changing operations

### üîí Infrastructure Security
- **Environment isolation** via Docker containers
- **Secure session management**
- **Rate limiting** (ready for implementation)
- **Redis security** with password protection

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# NEVER commit these files to version control
.env
backend/.env

# ALWAYS use strong passwords
DB_PASSWORD=secure_random_password_here
REDIS_PASSWORD=secure_random_password_here

# ALWAYS generate a new APP_KEY
php artisan key:generate
```

### Production Security Checklist
- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Generate new APP_KEY
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Configure proper CORS settings
- [ ] Set up proper firewall rules
- [ ] Enable rate limiting
- [ ] Configure proper file permissions
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Backup strategy implementation

### Database Security
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Limit database user privileges
- Enable query logging for monitoring
- Regular security updates
- Encrypted connections (TLS/SSL)

### Redis Security
- Use strong passwords
- Bind to specific interfaces
- Enable protected mode
- Regular security updates

## Security Headers

The application should be deployed with appropriate security headers:

```nginx
# Add these headers in your web server configuration
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## Known Security Considerations

### Rate Limiting
The application includes rate limiting infrastructure but requires configuration for production use. Implement rate limiting for:
- Login attempts
- API endpoints
- Password reset requests
- 2FA verification attempts

### Session Security
- Sessions are stored in Redis with appropriate expiration
- Session cookies should be configured with `secure` and `httpOnly` flags in production
- Consider implementing session rotation

### File Upload Security
If implementing file uploads:
- Validate file types and sizes
- Store uploads outside web root
- Scan for malware
- Implement proper access controls
