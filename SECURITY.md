## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
Security vulnerabilities should not be reported publicly until they have been fixed.

### 2. Send a detailed report via email
Send your vulnerability report to: **security@example.com** (replace with your actual email)

Include in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### 3. What to expect
- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability within 5 business days
- **Timeline**: We will provide a timeline for fixing the issue
- **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisories (if desired)

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# NEVER commit these files to version control
.env
backend/.env

# ALWAYS use strong passwords
DB_PASSWORD=secure_random_password_here
REDIS_PASSWORD=secure_random_password_here

# ALWAYS generate a new APP_KEY
php artisan key:generate
```

### Production Security Checklist
- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Generate new APP_KEY
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Configure proper CORS settings
- [ ] Set up proper firewall rules
- [ ] Enable rate limiting
- [ ] Configure proper file permissions
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Backup strategy implementation

### Database Security
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Limit database user privileges
- Enable query logging for monitoring
- Regular security updates
- Encrypted connections (TLS/SSL)

### Redis Security
- Use strong passwords
- Bind to specific interfaces
- Enable protected mode
- Regular security updates

## Security Headers

The application should be deployed with appropriate security headers:

```nginx
# Add these headers in your web server configuration
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

## Known Security Considerations

### Rate Limiting
The application includes rate limiting infrastructure but requires configuration for production use. Implement rate limiting for:
- Login attempts
- API endpoints
- Password reset requests
- 2FA verification attempts

### Session Security
- Sessions are stored in Redis with appropriate expiration
- Session cookies should be configured with `secure` and `httpOnly` flags in production
- Consider implementing session rotation

### File Upload Security
If implementing file uploads:
- Validate file types and sizes
- Store uploads outside web root
- Scan for malware
- Implement proper access controls

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
1. Vulnerabilities are fixed before public disclosure
2. Security researchers are credited appropriately
3. We maintain a security advisory process
4. Critical vulnerabilities receive priority treatment
